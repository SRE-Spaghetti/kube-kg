## 10. Infrastructure and Deployment

### 10.1. Infrastructure as Code

-   **Tool:** Docker & Kubernetes Manifests
-   **Location:** `Dockerfile` in the root, Kubernetes manifests in a `/deploy` directory.
-   **Approach:** The service will be packaged as a Docker container. Standard Kubernetes YAML files (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret) will be used to define how the service is deployed and configured within a cluster.

### 10.2. Deployment Strategy

-   **Strategy:** Rolling Update
-   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (recommended)
-   **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 10.3. Environments

-   **development:** For local development, connecting to local or development instances of KubeView and Neo4j.
-   **staging:** A pre-production environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Used for integration testing and validation.
-   **production:** The live environment serving end-users.

### 10.4. Environment Promotion Flow

```
[Local Development] -> [Git Push] -> [CI/CD Pipeline] -> [Staging Environment] -> [Manual Approval] -> [Production Environment]
```

### 10.5. Rollback Strategy

-   **Primary Method:** Re-deploying the previously tagged stable container image.
-   **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bug discovery, high error rates, negative performance impact.
-   **Recovery Time Objective:** < 15 minutes

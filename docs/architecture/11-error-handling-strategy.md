## 11. Error Handling Strategy

### 11.1. General Approach

-   **Error Model:** Standard Go `error` interface. Custom error types will be created to wrap standard errors with additional context (e.g., `ErrKubeViewConnection`, `ErrNeo4jTransaction`).
-   **Exception Hierarchy:** Not applicable in Go. Errors are returned as values.
-   **Error Propagation:** Errors will be wrapped with context at each layer of the call stack using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. This provides a full error trace.

### 11.2. Logging Standards

-   **Library:** `slog` (Go 1.21+ structured logging)
-   **Format:** JSON
-   **Levels:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`
-   **Required Context:**
    -   **Correlation ID:** A unique ID (e.g., from an OpenTelemetry trace) will be included in all logs related to a specific operation.
    -   **Service Context:** The component name (e.g., `processor`, `kubeview_client`) will be included.
    -   **User Context:** Not applicable for this service.

### 11.3. Error Handling Patterns

#### External API Errors (KubeView Client)

-   **Retry Policy:** Retry with exponential backoff for connection errors to the KubeView SSE stream.
-   **Circuit Breaker:** Not initially required for this service, but can be added if the KubeView API proves to be unstable.
-   **Timeout Configuration:** A reasonable timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) will be configured on the `http.Client` to prevent indefinite hangs.
-   **Error Translation:** KubeView API errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx) will be wrapped in custom error types.

#### Business Logic Errors

-   **Custom Exceptions:** Custom error types like `ErrInvalidEvent` or `ErrResourceMappingFailed` will be used.
-   **User-Facing Errors:** Not applicable. Errors will be logged internally.
-   **Error Codes:** Not required for this internal service.

#### Data Consistency (Neo4j Client)

-   **Transaction Strategy:** All write operations for a given unit of work (e.g., processing a single event, syncing a namespace) will be performed within a single Neo4j transaction.
-   **Compensation Logic:** If a transaction fails, it will be rolled back. The operation will be retried if the error is transient.
-   **Idempotency:** All Neo4j write queries will use `MERGE` to ensure that re-processing the same event does not create duplicate data.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Kube-KG, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### 1.1. Change Log

| Date       | Version | Description                        | Author  |
|:-----------|:--------|:-----------------------------------|:--------|
| 2025-09-17 | 1.0     | Initial draft of the architecture. | Winston |
| 2025-09-18 | 1.1     | Minor updates.                     | Sean    |

### 1.2. Starter Template or Existing Project
Based on the review of the `prd.md`, there is no mention of a specific starter template or an existing codebase. The PRD specifies that the service will be a standalone Go application built from scratch, implying a greenfield development approach. Therefore, the architecture will be designed from the ground up.
